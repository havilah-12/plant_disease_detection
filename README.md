# plant_disease_detection

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a deep learning-based plant disease classification system. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify diseases in plant leaves from images and delivers predictions via a user-friendly Streamlit interface. The app is fully containerized with Docker for seamless deployment.

## 🌱 Features
- Predicts plant diseases from leaf images

- Trained on a labeled dataset (e.g., PlantVillage)

- Real-time image upload and prediction in Streamlit

- CNN-based model trained using TensorFlow/Keras

- Fully dockerized for portability and deployment

🧰 Tech Stack
- Python

- TensorFlow/Keras – model training

- OpenCV + NumPy – image preprocessing

- Streamlit – UI for user interaction

- Docker – containerization and deployment

🧩 Key Components
Data Preprocessing:
