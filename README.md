# plant_disease_detection

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a deep learning-based plant disease classification system. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify diseases in plant leaves from images and delivers predictions via a user-friendly Streamlit interface. The app is fully containerized with Docker for seamless deployment.

## 🌱 Features
🌿 Predicts plant diseases from leaf images

📊 Trained on a labeled dataset (e.g., PlantVillage)

📷 Real-time image upload and prediction in Streamlit

🧠 CNN-based model trained using TensorFlow/Keras

🐳 Fully dockerized for portability and deployment

## 🧰 Tech Stack
